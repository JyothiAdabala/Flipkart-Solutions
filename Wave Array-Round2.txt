Wave Array

Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Modify the array to look like a wave. In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5.....
Note: The converted array must be the lexicographically smallest wave array.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 2 1 4 3 5
Explanation: Array elements after 
sorting it in wave form are 
2 1 4 3 5.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def convertToWave(self, arr, N):
        if(N%2 == 0):
            for i in range(0,N,2):
                arr[i] , arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
        else:
            for i in range(0,N-1,2):
                arr[i] , arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
        return arr
